Pathetic, $u lost a $d day streak on $g.
Really $u? Losing your streak on $g?
Imagine crawling back to $g. $u knows what I mean
Was it worth it $u? You lost your $d day streak on $g
$u :unamused: You know what you did. Does $g ring a bell?
$u came crawling back to $g, make sure to make fun of them for losing their $d day streak
HAHHAHAHAAHAH, you actually just lost your $d day streak on $g! $u is weak willed, laugh at them
I would give $u $100 if they could EVER make it past $d days without playing $g
Congrats $u for losing your $d day streak! Nah im joking, im quite dissapointed :unamused:
Only those of lesser stature would lose a $d day streak playing $g. $u?
Which of these players fumbled a $d day clean streak on the game "$g"? a. $u, b. $u, c. $u, d. $u
One day you'll break $d days $u. :face_holding_back_tears:
Hey $u, heres you: :clown:. Next time think before you play $g and lose your $d day streak
